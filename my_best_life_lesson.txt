To deal with fears and phobias (or any void that you wish to to fill with existance), the first step is not acknowledging thm or validating or whatnot

The first step is to see the benefit.

Why did you do it in the first place?

what good would come out of the fear? mention the current output.

the second step is to acknolwdge the fear and phobea. But you see, now you know why its there. And that attention fills the void with pure existance.
