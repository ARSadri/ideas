To deal with fears and phobias (or any void that you wish to to fill with existance), the first step is NOT acknowledging them or validating or what not

The first step is to see their BENEFIT: Why did you hve the feeling in the first place? what good would possibly come out of the fear? 

mention the current possible good output. Then the second step is to acknolwdge the fear and phobea and follow the advice of millions of pyschologists out there. But you see, now you know why its there. And that attention fills the void with pure existance.
