Currently there are three
make the rules
execute the rules
judicial to decide about a matter based on the rules

Judicial is activated when a matter is brought to its attention, it doesn't look for information by itself.

A society can have sustainability only with these three. These three do not reflect the future of a society. Future of a society is determined by the society only if it has proper feedback

as suck i suggest the forth pillar
reporter chosen by people....these are people who are completely indipendent of the other three and pretty much can go inside any room belonging to governemtn to observe whenever they like whereever they like

these are the eyes and ears of people inside the entire governemnt, specially military

There must be an election for each of these separately and can be once in four years....and each of these could be elected on one of the four years

and as i have proposed before, the election is merely puting into effect what is the current outcome of the 24/7 voting of people on absolutely every matter that is put forth by the congress.....that is that th econgreess has no decision making power except to bring options to the website

if a vote drops below half, it is immidiately effective.
