There are rules about children in Australian law. 

Well, AI is in its infancy. AI is a child.

Government needs to know if parent of an NN is treating it right, what goes in it, how it is maintained but not exactly what it is or it does.

Moreover, we need to make sure that a child doesn't do serious work for life money. If it does, we need to quantify its smartness and tax parents.

if AI is not a child, What AI recieves is taxable. What AI recieves, is input data at inference time. At each time, the input is triggered it can be taxed
