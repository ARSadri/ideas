There are ruls about children in Australian law. 

Well, AI is in its infancy. AI is a child.

Government need to know if parent of a NN is treating it right, what goes in it how it is maintained but not exactly what it is or it can do.

if AI is not a child,

What AI recieves is taxable. What AI recieves is input data. At each time the input is triggered it can be taxed
