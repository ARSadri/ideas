1- We are not perfect, it means that we may start translating part of the book and use the numencluture to form mathmatical notations, then use the notations to come up with conclusions then "search" for the conclusion in the book

This word: search is probably not exactly something trivial and may be strongly pronounced in modern world

incidently the search concepts and tools are naturally modern since the proessing has been possible via computerization of human understanding

As you can see the entire process is happening outside of the book

Also

2-We are all humnas, that means that in the face of absolutely anything adn any word includig the sentence "Read", we are immidiately full of questions and ideas.
That is that the first of us and all of us will be interacting with those who would like us to understand ourselves and would help us.

The first word comes in and a million question goes out and the next word ccomes in and so on and so forth. As such we have a book. 

Now after many years, what is the difference between us and the first of us? There is no difference. We can read it as such. We will be reading ourselves.

3-When you are dealing with a dead book, you can only benefit from it if you are exactly the same as thos who read it first. Because the purpose of the book was to address
capabilites and help the elfers understand it. Therefore, either you have to live the life of the eleders, or forget it.

But it is incorrect that this book is dead. It transforms and changes as you connect with it. This is a personal journey and the experienc ecan be reported. as such. This however, does not mean that you can
separate yourself from the knowldge that all the elders had. Because you seek to use the relationship they established for yourself.

This is possible. Simply because there are elements in this relationship that has not changed, whatever they are. The personal journey will determine what they are for you.
