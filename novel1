Imagine a midicine-shot was invented that would randomly allow some people to become pregnant and prevent others, (uniformly with average half).

After the chaos was gone, since those who could give birth to children, would have to deal with a very sensitive matter, as sensitive as a child is, would be in the position that women have been in history.

The novel like story could go through the changes that human kind went through in history to show how this happens.

Never forget that those who could give birth to a child have all the abilities that those who can't have, but because of the sensitivity of the matter, they have to make many sacrifices.

In the face of insecurities in a society, there will not be rules to protect the half that can reproduce. Power plays start and prevent those who can from gainging their social status back to benefit those who have been more present during the games.

Incidently, those in power who try to keep the power to themselves try to bring up issues that require long lasting attentions to prove that those who where dealing with children don'e have the experiences. This is while the job of taking care of children should be divided between the two groups and there should be numerous opportunities and support for those who can give birth to children to go back to work.
