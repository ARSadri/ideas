A bad experience is not the result of a bad action, it is the bad action....Existance is flowing, like a river, it wants the best for you, take you places that are wonderful, you divert it, it will take you places you are not ready for, that is a bad experience...you see, the problem is not what exists, the problem is that you divert it with ignoring where it is taking you, so you block it. Stop blocking it.

Can you be purposfully egoless?
