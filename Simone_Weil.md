Simone Weil
-----------

I would say that she was an anti-monopoly.

The idea behind integration of bussinesses is to create the feeling that all resources are well provided for employees and only by the source. This produces a sense of security and margin at the surface while creates a fear of exclusion at depth. Repetition of aquiring resources form a single source, anchors system 1 in our brain.

Clearly, system 2 in Simone Weil was activated to fight the anchor.

This is because she saw that all resources provided by businesses are rooted within each human and is available to all of us. This is because she saw that all feelings are in fact pores which should be filled with eternal love. Seeing this as the reason for existance of feelings, allowed her to conclude that all resources advetised by integration of bussinesses are in fact already availble and well spread among people. On the other hand, monopolies where many aspect of a business are integrated offer security that in fact is incomplete. yet the effect is that the pores are covered and love is not received. (Same thing is said exactly by Ibn Arabi) That naturally leads to her fights against monopolies.

A clear example of this is rapid changes in social interactions. The idea of bussiness active in this sector is to perform or behave so exoticly that everyday people stand asaide. That way, people would not assume that the resources are rooted within themselves and would let go of trying to discover thier inner capabilities. Since if they would, they would not need the bussiness. To fight this many artists tried to show specially young adults that they need to discover who they are and what they can do. This is the main reason behind all sudden changes of modern western society within last 400 years.
