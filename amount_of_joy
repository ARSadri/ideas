joy is when existance moves from this border to another. more like holes moving from the other to this.

sorrow is when the existance is taken away to where it does not give it back.

liking something that doesn't last and enjoying it, will end in sorrow.

The speed of transfer of existance gives the amount of joy. As such clearer channels provide more joy. If the channel is soft and open as a result of much communication, the joy is ireplacable.
