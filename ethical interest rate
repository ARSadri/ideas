the summation of rental and the value of a house should make up the entire money spent to buy a house. As the new owner take more of a house the rent goes down.
the reason that i suggest intrest rate should have such a formula is that society choses rental price by more wisdom that what wealthy class uses to chose the interest rate. This is because house is a real thing and people relate to it which is why they buy it
