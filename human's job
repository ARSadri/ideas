If there is a void, human is capable of filling it with existance,
but humna is not supposed to create voids, rather he is only supposed to fill in

If a human sees somebody elese seeing a void and filling it in and feels jealouse, he may
try to create the void so that he can fill it with existance, as such turns into the non-existing side of himself.
