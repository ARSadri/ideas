You cannot sell a share whose prive you know is about to fall....you are responsible for the loss....

As such there must be a decaying responsibility for losses of sold shares. with a time constant setable according to inflation. This means that if there is inflation, there must be loss responsibility.

This is how you tackle inflation. by increasing the responsibility persiod of the seller of absolutely anything. As such the sellers will not sell anything on a price that they know falls. because of that people will buy with conficence hence the cash rate hence the rapid drop of inflation

the best way to fight inflation other than interest rate

See? interetst rate is not the solution to inflation

This is the solution that should replace settting the interest rate above the proposed threshold (interest rate must be set by setting the mortage equal to the rent of a house)

See? no one has ever solved this problem before me....interesting ....no?

BTW the rule that you have to pay the loss after something is sold is called khiar_e_ghabn
