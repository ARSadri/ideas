I grew up in what is often called the "Third World," and later, I moved to other countries and lived among them for years. My journey has been one of seeking understanding—of myself, of others, and of the rich diversity of human experience that stretches across different cultures, philosophies, and histories. I have studied the philosophies of both the East and the West, and through this, I have come to get closer to the unity of existence that connects us all.

In my search for knowledge, I have realized that the idea of superiority based on race or physical appearance is, at best, a shallow distraction. These traits are just part of the diverse makeup of humanity, and they serve more as challenges to overcome than as measures of one’s worth. The same is true for knowledge and information; having more knowledge may bring greater responsibility, but it doesn’t automatically make someone better than another.

Skin color, height, cultural heritage, or even a history of art and knowledge are just circumstances—opportunities, perhaps, but not what defines our value. These are steps on the path of human progress, leading us toward a higher goal: offering every part of ourselves to the divine essence, the pure existence we call God. In doing so, we seek to regain the fullness we lost in the descent of God into these earthly forms and move toward the next stage of our spiritual journey.

If you believe you lack nothing and are purely complete (racist), then perhaps you do not see yourself as part of this shared human experience. But if you acknowledge, as I do, that you are a part of God—a part as in "not the whole"— then you must also recognize your journey back to God. The specific challenges and limits you face are not ends in themselves; they are the pathways to fulfilling your purpose.

So, are you, or are you not, a human like me? Are you not also trying to understand what limits you and striving to reconnect with the source of all existence? If you are, then join me in this quest, because it is only by facing and overcoming our limitations that we truly grow.

I understand that each of us can best express our challenges and hopes within our own cultural and linguistic contexts. I can communicate with those who share my language and background more efficiently. But this advantage does not define me; it merely helps me recognize what I lack. What truly defines me is the existence I have not missed through my connection with God, which comes from treating every little thing in its naturally right way.

If you believe you are better than me, it should be because you have recognized your limitations and are more aware of your flaws than I am. This basically means that if we were to count flaws, you would have more and appear as "the loser". You connect more deeply, flow more naturally through life, and perhaps your very being is more attuned to the divine: your eyes hear, your ears see, your legs speak, and your hands move the stars, all because you have given in being "you", and the devine fills you the way divine wants and that has no error. The error would be not to see how you ignore how the divine fills you in.

But if, my fellow human, you do not embody these qualities, then please, I ask you, do not think of yourself as better than me. What you think you have more is just problems the same as I do. I cannot see why you would be better than me because of "skin color" or "race". We are obstacles, we are the problems, not the solution.

I come from a land where people have been forced to think is behind in human civiliation or an understanding of modern life. I have lived the life more advanced nations hold up as a standard; I understand some of the pop culture, the literature, the art. I have read some novels, watched some movies, and yet, I cannot see how anyone is better than other people.

Noone's race is superior, the color of their skin is not more beautiful, and their athletes are not inherently better—if all countries have the resources needed, the outcomes would be more or less the same. Noone is more sophisticated, more capable; and the advancement of some societies is simply a natural result of circumstances they live in, not inherent superiority. If resources were available, they would result in more or less similar progress.

we may say that people of some countries have been thinking critically for the last 400 years. Yes, critical thinking, when grounded in truth, leads to progress. But when critical thinking is detached from truth, it gives rise to the governance of ego: monopolism, imperialism, fascism, and totalitarianism—all of which lead to disasters. Even today, the so-called "scientism" without ethics has contributed to the coronavirus pandemic—a stark reminder that we are all vulnerable, no matter where we come from. Throughout human history, critical thinking has been guided by the truths witnessed by those with pure faith, represented in true problems that require our immediate attention, leading to technological advancements that have supported human life and allowed for sustainable progress. But now, we face a different challenge—a "consuming society" that is not only blind to the truth and unsatisfied, but also deeply troubled by technologies it does not know how to control.

So, what now? we must lead the way forward, away from the next crisis. Why should it matter where such leaders come from? racism will not save us. Whoever they are, should have lived a life of full attention to every moment and everything.
