I would like to coin a phrase, processed joy.

We know what processed food doesn, our body can processing units that go out of scale when they are not triggered to their sensitivity.

Same is with our ability to match multiple aspects of existance in an object or gods names. When we see many aspects in relation to each other we enjoy.

If joyful things are processed, all problems are washed away and thos aspects an object or a phenomenon lacks will be covered by a lie.

our feelings will die when joy is processed and we have feelings to process existance in objects.

too much processed joy bring in depression.
