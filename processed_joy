I would like to coin a phrase, processed joy.

We know what processed food does to our body, our processing units become unsually sensitive when they are not triggered to their current sensitivity thresholds.

Same is with our ability to match multiple aspects of existance in an object. When we see many aspects in relation to each other we enjoy 

If only joyful part of actuibs are use and the entire action with all of its hardships is not performed and all problems are earased away, 
       those aspects that the object lacks will be covered by a lie.

our feelings will die when joy is processed and we have feelings to process non-existance in objects to fill them in with our attention.

too much processed-joy brings in depression....which make take many forms, e.g. constant rage which maybe replaced with constant need for consumption
