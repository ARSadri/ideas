I would like to coin a phrase, processed joy.

We know what processed food does to our body, our processing units become usually sensitive when they are not triggered to their current sensitivity thresholds.

Same is with our ability to match multiple aspects of existence in an object. When we see many aspects in relation to each other we enjoy 

If only joyful part of actions is use and the entire action with all of its hardships is not performed and all problems are erased away, 
       those aspects that the object lacks will be covered by a lie.

The lie is formed as follows: The reason we can enjoy is that we can see that multiple names have gathered together. However, that requires effort of attention which we know as doing hard things. Things are hard to do when names are highly separated by us. We pay sincere attention and names gather together which we know as working hard to learn something or take an action that requires bravery
As such we could lie about the number of names we have gathered together or the quality of the attention we pay during our effort or as we know it, how hard we are actually working.

In other words, the sugar of our existence should only be poured into the smoothie of hardship. if we pour it in games or a lot of it into a little bit of work, we have consumed our sugar without gaining much "existence". Processed joy is extracting our ability to enjoy reality in order to taste it too early too fast without the hardship of reality.

our feelings will die when joy is processed and we have feelings to process non-existence in objects to fill them in with our attention.

too much processed-joy brings in depression.... which may take many forms, e.g. constant rage which may be replaced with constant need for consumption
