We are incomplete...the way this happens is through naming objects. As I mentioned in Jordan Curve Theorem article, we separate things from ech other in the world of hamind mind.

As such, connecting two names back to each other seems like a temproriliy goal. This is a game. managing to get it done is fun.

Then games are designed to represent this process. We set a  goal for ourselves and try to achieve it...The games are ethicallly justified in history of ethics when they would teach us about such a process. The fact that everything is a unity, then we name thema and separate them like finding a lock that needs a key and then finding the key and bringing them back together satisfies our deep need of going back to god.

As such, games are joyful...Joy is the link between two names...imaging a jordan curve that is the combination of two curves. This thing is joy.

Joy is a "thing". joy and fun is an object....And as mentioned in the case of daydreaming, god does not require us, or give birth to something to be outside of it or is born by anything to get outside of something and nothing is like it. We are like each other and fun is like any oher object in god. Games that are designed to brin joy and fun, are designed so that you see this aspect of being human in it.

as games become harder and then impossibe for anyone to finish all the fun is gone. As they become simpler as no two things are really apart, and achiving the connection seems even inevitable, they become less fun.. To ethically study a game maybe is to see how much it helps us understand how things go apart and how they are brought back together. As such, deveopment of a gold should be part of a game. This is why some games are more fun than the others. 

Maybe a game is a good game that shows us that this is us who is the source of the problem as we are incomplete and away from God. For example, we are supposed to bring back a sinki from the deepest part of the pool...but we are also the one who throws it in there. The questoin is how deep we are willing to throw it in. In this game if we trrow it to a low or large depth, we may lose the game as we may not score high or never get it.

life is a perfectly designed game.
