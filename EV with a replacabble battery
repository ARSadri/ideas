I have an idea...

I can replace a cars engine with electric engine, and replace its  fuel tank with a container for a battery tht can be pulled out and replaced with another one that we give them to take home for charging.

we also give the charging station and two trolleys . One to put the battery in the car inside the charger and one to take the one in the charger back to the car.

The car will have a little door to the container where the battery can be accessed the trolley is in the exact height and when connects electrically can allow the battery to be moved.
