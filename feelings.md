Why do we have feelings?

The job of mind is to close the system of universe. This is done via creating a circular chain of causality which we call science.

The circle of causality can be cut in any shape or form to pretend that the system has always been this way and always will be.

However the system is actually open. Feelings show where and how it can be found where the system is open.

A feeling occurs when existance is lacking in an object. The source of existance needs to be contacted to allow creation of new aspects of existance in the object. By reacting to a feeling, the only thing that happens is that the attention shifts from one aspect of existance in an object to the other. By contacting the source of existance, the allowance for creation of another aspect can be obtained. This way the attention does not have to shift in between aspects. Rather, the attention can now be focused on the more complete form of the object whcich has a greater existance.

Feelings allow us to know that it is possible to contact the source to gain the allowance in face of our occluded understanding of the universrse.

This I call responding to a feeling.

(A reaction to a feeling is to try to feel somthing else. For example, in face of sadness we listen to music or in face of anxiety we eat. Obviously, eating eating can be the last stage of response to hunger and will remove hunger and anxiety will still be there. Ego says Oh I have done somthing about my anxiety and why didn't it work? I must be forgotten and abondanded and abondenment fear creates more anxiety.)

To respond to feelings, for each feeling, there is a different way of contacting the source, obtaining the allowance for creation of a name that I explained where I introduced my set theory.

For hunger, there is attention to what we have had before and be thankful for it and to feed others. A readtion would be to just eat.
For anger, there is attention to the unknown parameters, and looking for new rules, A reaction would be to judge based on mere past and not the present.

Among all feelings, the most important one is exclamation which triggers all systems in our brain. 
No feeling drives man as exclamation does. This is the feeling that drives science, ambition, greed and envy.

The response to exclamation is praying. The reaction would be to simpy follow what has surprised us.  
During praying we make too big of a deal about god, the perfect version of everything which is unity as no perfect lacks anything any other perfect has
this allows us to remain concious when surprises arrive in life not to make too big of a deal out of them.

This I call worshiping. As we gain allowance to create new aspects of existance in a n object we do not close the system, rather show that the system is open.

But we need to remember to connect to the source when we are surprised. That is almost impossible since the surprise will take us at the moment it arrives.

This is why we pray 5 times a day and this is why we have feelings. To worship.
