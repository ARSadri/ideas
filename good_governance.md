The idea is simple, there must be a 24 / 7 possiblitiy for the public to vote for every matter and the job of governemnt is three folds.

1- propose options for every entry in the system and allow people to constantly change their mind.
2- regulate and enforced the current law
3- The job of a governemnt is to sell insurance.

You own what you insure.

This way govenrments have to keep society as perfect as possible to avoid paying for compensations.
