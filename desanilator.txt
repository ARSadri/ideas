Long ago when I was 20 I had this simple idea that you make a dome on top of water made by metal....then it gets very hot in there ( obviously you can put frames from which you pass dc electricity coming from solar panesl on the dome) then vapor comes up and pressure inreases
  there will be small holes at the top of the dome from which steam can run into a pipe that swirls underneath the dome to a well where condensation happens.

  notice that since the pipes are under the dome under the water....salt will increase and tempretures increase but waves keep it generally cool....then you pump out the water...
