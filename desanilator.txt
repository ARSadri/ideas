Long ago when I was 20 I had this simple idea that you make a dome on top of water made by metal....
then it gets very hot in there ( obviously you can put frames from which you pass dc electricity 
coming from solar panesl on the dome) then vapor comes up and pressure inreases
  there will be small holes at the top of the dome from which steam can run into a pipe
that swirls underneath the dome to a well where condensation happens.

in fact the pipe does not go out of the dome.....imagine a pipe going from above the water to inside the water,
at the inlet of the pipe there is a fan that pushes air in. This alone without a dome on top of will produce water
because there is vapor in the air.

But when you add a dome around it and maybe connet electricity to the part of the frame that is on the surface to make it hot (only on the surface)
the amount of vapor increases because the pressure under the dome is reduced.

  notice that since the pipes are under the dome under the water....salt will increase
and tempretures increase but waves keep it generally cool....then you pump out the water...

also warm water rises to the surface where the dome is
