The problem of wishful thinking is as follows:

You are in position A, for example you have job A or partner A, you think that in this situation A, you are not listened to...that is that, what you "truely" find desirable or reasonable has not recieved attention....
You think that you will look at what is truely important for you and you will chose position B or partnet B that already has considered your position or at least you will make sure that you go ahead with your choioce only on the condition 
that the new situation does have what you think is desirable or reasonable.

I have not said the issue yet...wait....I know you are clever and you know what I am going to say next....no....please wait. You will do the transition and move to position B or partnet B only to find out that there is something else 
they are missing. wait....

that is not the issue...wait

But in the middle of all this, now we have Artificial Intelligence....The idea is that it will have exactly what we want....right? you basically set the scene...right? ok wait...I have not yet told you the issue.... 
obviuosly for a long time you will chase this tail of humanity only come to realize that the training dataset is coming from humans and the thingy you interact with is limited. wait! I have not told you the issue yet....

So far your youth is finished....that surely is AN issue but it is not the issue....

By the time your are fourty you realize that whatever you do or whereever you go from A to B to C to D to ...., this fact that there is a part of you missing... This discovery is not the issue...

Now I am going to tell you the issue...

You have no clue why....what is it that is missing?....what is it that actually is driving you mad?....

The issue is not even the asnwer, because the answer is right there and you know it....the issue is that you are closed to it...you cannot open up...you can not accept the answer...
you find something in you that shouldn't be there if you would to accept the answer

Now there are people around you that tell you, oh no, I look at the bright side of moving from A to B to C to D and constantly do it...They always leave a mess behind....a mess that needs to be cleaned up after they leave from Y to Z.

And now the answer, yes, you are missing something that is common between all you exhustive search for perfection...yes there is....YUHUHUHUHAHAHAHA....and incidently I know it.

and no, I cannot tell you because you are not asking for it and you are not asking for it because you already know. (This is the sentence that burnt you and made you feel pitty for yourself and to deny it, you felt pitty for me with a bit of anger)
