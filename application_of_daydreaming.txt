A daydreaming out of control is depicted in "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (2013).

The question is what exactly is it that helps with this condition. 

The day dreaming always fulfills a need. As such the target should be imagingin (delibretly dreaming) the result of /trying / not-trying to fill in the need by our attention and in Quranic term: "ghofran",

If a person finds themselves day-dreaming, they should make sure they are aware of the root reason or feeling and imaging paying attention to it and not paying attention to it.

This way two things will happen, one is that the imagination is guided to think about the root feeling which will hopefullu open their heart more and two the brain learns to think of both scenarios and as such day-dreaming will always be altered in the middle automatically. This excercise will help with increasing the chance of katching a day-dream in the middle to pay attention to the root.

And if the person is asking why I should get better, the answer is simple, god doesn't need you and god has not had you out of gods self. Your existance, whatever it looks like is only to worship your god. You cannot possibly be doing anything else. It is just that as you lie to yourself that you are out of gods reach by seeking immortality through imagingation, you will be bringing suffering upon yourself.

The above excercise helps you to lie to yourself less.

Remember that daydreaming is a game. I have now begun my writing on "games". (About to open)
