wThere are many of those thinkers that tell us not to mix topics

I tell them this: Human is a mixed creature and you are in position of power.

What power? The power of articulation and separation of topics.

However, there are always those who wish to have the power that academics have over the hearts and minds of people and yet do not qualify for those seats

As such they impose dictatorship of all kinds. Then the thinkers tell us that in order for use everyday guys to be in position of power we should not mix topics.

I am against this. I do not seek power when I differentiate topics. And I don't differentiate them to tear my sould apart. Rather, I differentiate topics to shift my attention.

and I mix topics back when I am healthy.

This live book does that. There are examples ofseparating topics from teach other and then gathering them back in the end.
