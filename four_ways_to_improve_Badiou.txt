Badiou: "Truth enters into the world not as a state but as a process, or more specifically as four (and only four) processes: love, politics, art and science."

As per Unity of Existance, there are two main aspects to exitance of every object one is that we are decesendents of truth (pure existance is Alrahmaan) and two that we all wish to ascend back to purity (pure existance is Alrahim).

Badiou does not have the first part (becasue he thinks "not as a state" but Simon Weil does, as she insists that man has to see his void), 
but Badiou is suggesting that there are four main ways things can process to increase in existance and raise back. 
(Simon Weil does have the second one as well as she cares about filling the void)

I say, In every situation in life you should first see what there is and where you are and what it is you are dealing with (Alrahmaan)
second, you have to begin looking into how you can improve the situation via either of the following four and more ways:
love (to help it continue in its existance such as saving lives)
knowledge (to get to know it better)
politics (to ensure it has its rights)
art (to help it become more beautiful)

and I sorted these four based on their importance and possility of being persued.
